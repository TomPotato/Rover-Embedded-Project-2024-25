<h1 align="center">The Mars Rover</h1>
<p>With this project we aim to get a better understanding of what skills developing a Mars Rover takes.</p>
<p><i>"How does a Rover really work?","What defines a Rover?"</i></p>
<p>While it would be challenging to build a full Mars Rover in a limited timeframe, understanding how they work and the challenges engineers face can give us a greater appreciation for the level of innovation and precision that goes into their development.</p>
