# The Mars Rover
With this project we aim to get a better understanding of what developing a Mars Rover takes.
"What makes a robot effectively a Rover?","What are the challenges engeneers around the globe face to develope one?", ultimately "How does a Rover really work?"
While it would be challenging to build a full Mars Rover in a limited timeframe, understanding how they work and the challenges engineers face can give us a greater appreciation for the level of innovation and precision that goes into their development. 

## The finished Product
